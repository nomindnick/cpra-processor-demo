## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Educational Demonstration Only

**THIS APPLICATION IS NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE AND WILL FAIL IN REAL CPRA PROCESSING.**

This is an educational demonstration built to illustrate the accessibility of local AI models for public agencies. Key limitations:

- ⚠️ **Will produce inaccurate results** on real CPRA requests beyond the simplified synthetic test data
- ⚠️ **Not legal advice** - This tool does not provide legal guidance or replace legal counsel
- ⚠️ **Requires legal review** - All determinations must be reviewed by qualified legal professionals
- ⚠️ **Simplified workflow** - Real CPRA processing involves far more complexity than this demo addresses
- ⚠️ **Small model limitations** - Responsiveness and exemption determinations are inherently subjective and beyond the capability of these models to accurately assess in production scenarios

**The demo uses synthetic emails specifically designed to produce obvious results.** Do not use this application for actual CPRA compliance - consult with legal counsel for production needs.

- **30 emails**: 2-4 minutes (with gemma3)
- **Memory usage**: <8GB typical, <16GB peak
- **Accuracy**: >90% on test dataset
- **Export time**: <30 seconds

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Model configuration
export CPRA_MODEL_NAME="gemma3:latest"
export CPRA_MODEL_TEMPERATURE="0.2"
export CPRA_MODEL_MAX_TOKENS="800"

# Processing configuration
export CPRA_BATCH_SIZE="5"
export CPRA_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT="30"

# Demo mode
export CPRA_DEMO_MODE="true"
export CPRA_DEMO_SPEED="1.0"
```

### Configuration File

Edit `src/config/app_config.py` for advanced settings:
- Model parameters
- Processing timeouts
- Batch sizes
- Export formats
- Demo mode defaults

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Ollama Connection Error**
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# Restart Ollama service
systemctl restart ollama  # Linux
brew services restart ollama  # macOS
```

**Model Not Found**
```bash
# List available models
ollama list

# Pull missing model
ollama pull gemma3:latest
```

**Memory Issues**
- Reduce batch size in configuration
- Use smaller model (gemma3 instead of gpt-oss:20b)
- Close other applications

**Slow Processing**
- Ensure no other CPU-intensive tasks running
- Try gemma3 model for faster processing
- Reduce number of concurrent requests

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE - EDUCATIONAL DEMONSTRATION ONLY**

This is a demonstration application built SOLELY for educational purposes to illustrate the accessibility of local AI technology for public agencies. It is NOT intended for actual CPRA processing and WILL FAIL in production environments.

### Critical Limitations

This application has fundamental limitations that make it unsuitable for real-world use:

1. **Accuracy Issues**: The AI will produce inaccurate determinations on real CPRA requests. The demo uses synthetic data specifically designed to be obvious - real requests are far more complex.

2. **Model Limitations**: Small language models like gemma3 cannot accurately assess the inherently subjective determinations of document responsiveness and exemption applicability that real CPRA processing requires.

3. **Workflow Oversimplification**: The two-pass analysis approach is simultaneously too simple for production accuracy and wasteful (analyzing non-responsive documents for exemptions).

4. **Not Legal Advice**: This tool does NOT provide legal advice. All output requires review by qualified legal professionals familiar with CPRA requirements.

5. **No Warranty**: The software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for complete terms.

### Before Any Use

Users are STRONGLY ADVISED to:
- Consult with legal counsel before any official capacity use
- NOT rely on this software for actual CPRA compliance
- Thoroughly test and validate any adapted code
- Understand this is a technology demonstration, not a legal compliance tool

**The goal of this project is to inspire thinking about local AI possibilities, not to provide a production-ready CPRA solution.**

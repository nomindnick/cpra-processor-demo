## 🎭 Demo Script

### Part 1: Introduction (2 minutes)

**Opening Statement**:
> "Today I'll demonstrate how public agencies can leverage artificial intelligence to process public records requests while maintaining complete data privacy. This entire system runs locally on a laptop—no internet connection required."

**Key Points to Cover**:
- ✈️ Point out airplane mode icon in system tray
- 🔒 Emphasize: "Your sensitive documents never leave this device"
- 💰 Cost savings: "No cloud API fees, no subscription costs"
- 🏛️ Compliance: "Maintains full control for government agencies"

**Show Network Tab**:
- Open browser developer tools
- Show Network tab is empty (no external requests)
- "As you can see, absolutely no data is being transmitted"

### Part 2: Data Upload (1 minute)

**Navigate to Upload Page**:

1. **Click "Load Demo Data" button**:
   > "I've prepared a realistic dataset of 30 emails from a municipal construction project. These represent the types of documents agencies handle daily."

2. **Show the loaded emails briefly**:
   > "These emails include project updates, legal discussions, personnel matters, and routine administrative content."

3. **Display CPRA requests**:
   > "Here are three typical public records requests we might receive:"
   - Point out Request 1 (roof leaks) - straightforward
   - Point out Request 2 (change orders) - involves legal review
   - Point out Request 3 (delays) - may contain personnel information

### Part 3: Enable Demo Mode (30 seconds)

**Open Sidebar**:

1. **Toggle Demo Mode ON**:
   > "For this presentation, I'll enable demo mode which provides visual feedback of the AI processing."

2. **Point out features**:
   - Processing speed control (keep at 1.0x)
   - Resource monitoring (will show CPU/RAM usage)
   - Animation settings

3. **Show Network Status**:
   - Point to "✈️ Offline (Airplane Mode)" indicator
   > "Notice the system confirms we're completely offline"

### Part 4: Processing Demonstration (3-4 minutes)

**Click "Start Processing"**:

1. **Initial Processing**:
   > "The system is now parsing 30 emails and analyzing them against our three CPRA requests."

2. **Highlight Key Visuals** as processing occurs:
   
   **Email Parsing Phase**:
   > "First, we extract and structure the email data..."
   
   **Responsiveness Analysis**:
   > "Now the AI is determining which emails are responsive to each request. Notice it's not just keyword matching—it understands context."
   
   **Exemption Detection**:
   > "The system is also identifying potential exemptions—attorney-client privilege, personnel records, and deliberative process documents."

3. **Point Out Live Indicators**:
   - 🤖 AI thinking animation
   - 📊 Processing statistics updating in real-time
   - ⚡ Documents per second metric
   - 💾 Memory usage staying under 8GB

4. **Explain the Intelligence**:
   > "The AI understands that an email about 'structural issues' relates to 'roof leaks' even without those exact words. This is semantic understanding, not just keyword search."

### Part 5: Results Dashboard (2 minutes)

**Navigate to Results Page**:

1. **Show Summary Statistics**:
   > "In under 3 minutes, we've processed all 30 emails. Here's what the AI found:"
   - X responsive documents
   - Y with potential exemptions
   - Z non-responsive

2. **Demonstrate Grouping**:
   
   **Click "Responsive" tab**:
   > "These documents are potentially responsive to at least one request."
   
   **Click "Exemptions" tab**:
   > "These require legal review for potential redactions or withholding."
   
   **Click "Non-Responsive" tab**:
   > "These emails about office parties and routine maintenance aren't relevant."

3. **Show Confidence Levels**:
   > "The AI provides confidence scores, helping staff prioritize their review efforts. High confidence determinations might need less scrutiny."

### Part 6: Document Review (2 minutes)

**Navigate to Review Page**:

1. **Select a Document**:
   > "Let's review how the AI analyzed this specific email..."

2. **Show AI Analysis**:
   - Point out the reasoning provided
   - Show identified exemptions with explanations
   - Demonstrate confidence scoring

3. **Demonstrate Override**:
   > "Human judgment always takes precedence. If the AI made an error..."
   - Click "Override" 
   - Change determination
   - Add review note
   > "The system tracks all human decisions for audit purposes."

4. **Batch Approval** (if time permits):
   > "For efficiency, staff can batch-approve AI determinations they agree with."

### Part 7: Export Generation (1 minute)

**Navigate to Export Page**:

1. **Show Export Options**:
   > "Once review is complete, we can generate professional outputs:"

2. **Click "Generate Production PDF"**:
   > "This creates a PDF of all responsive, non-exempt documents."

3. **Click "Generate Privilege Log"**:
   > "This documents why certain records were withheld—essential for legal compliance."

## 💡 Demo Tips

### Do's
- ✅ Emphasize offline operation multiple times
- ✅ Let processing animations run (they're impressive)
- ✅ Show actual document content briefly
- ✅ Highlight cost savings vs cloud solutions
- ✅ Mention open-source nature (transparency)

### Don'ts
- ❌ Don't rush through processing (let audience see it work)
- ❌ Don't get too technical about AI models
- ❌ Don't skip the human override demonstration
- ❌ Don't forget to show airplane mode

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Ollama isn't responding:
```bash
# In a new terminal:
ollama serve
# Then retry the demo
```

### If processing seems slow:
- Explain this is running on a laptop, not a server
- Mention that production systems would be faster
- Note that it's still faster than manual review

### If an error occurs:
- Emphasize this is a demo/prototype

> A: Yes, the system can be extended to PDFs, Word documents, and other formats. This demo focuses on emails as they're the most common.

**Q: What about very large datasets?**
> A: The system scales linearly. 300 documents would take about 30 minutes. Batch processing can run overnight for very large sets.

**Q: Is this legally defensible?**
> A: Yes, with proper documentation and human review. The audit trail shows all AI determinations and human overrides, providing complete transparency.

**Q: How much does this cost to implement?**
> A: The software is free and open-source. Costs include staff time for implementation (2-4 weeks) and standard hardware (any modern laptop or server).

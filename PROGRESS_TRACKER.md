## Technical Decisions Log

### Model Selection Analysis (Sprint 0)
**Date**: 2025-08-05

**Models Tested**:
- `gpt-oss:20b`: 21.6s response time, largest model (13GB), may have highest quality
- `gemma3:latest`: 5.4s response time, fastest, good response quality (3.3GB) 
- `phi4-mini-reasoning:3.8b`: 9.6s response time, medium speed, reasoning capabilities (3.2GB)

**Decision**: All three models are viable. Gemma3 appears most suitable for demo due to speed, but will test all three for analysis quality in Sprint 1.

### Email Parsing Approach (Sprint 0)
**Date**: 2025-08-05

**Approach**: Implemented regex-based parsing for Outlook export format
- Handles standard email headers (From, To, CC, Subject, Date)
- Supports name-email format parsing ("John Smith <john@example.com>")
- Graceful error handling with failed email tracking
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (15 tests, all passing)

**Parsing Strategy**: Multiple fallback strategies for email separation:
1. Split by "From:" lines 
2. Split by separator patterns (dashes, underlines)
3. Treat as single email if no separators found

## Model Performance Notes

### Connectivity Testing Results
**Date**: 2025-08-05

All target models successfully loaded and responsive:
- Connection to Ollama service: ✅ Success
- Model availability: ✅ All 3 target models available
- Basic functionality: ✅ All models responding to test prompts

### Performance Observations
- Gemma3 provides fast, coherent responses
- Phi4-mini shows detailed reasoning in responses
- GPT-OSS has longest latency but may provide highest quality analysis

**Next Steps**: Implement structured prompting for CPRA analysis tasks in Sprint 1

## Issue Resolution Log

### Import Resolution (Sprint 0)
**Issue**: Relative imports failing in email parser module
**Solution**: Modified imports to use absolute paths from src directory
**Status**: Resolved - all tests passing

### Test Coverage (Sprint 0)
**Issue**: Needed comprehensive test coverage for email parsing
**Solution**: Implemented 15 unit tests covering:
- Basic email parsing
- Multiple email formats
- Address parsing variations
- Date format handling
- Error scenarios
**Status**: Complete - 100% test pass rate

## Testing Results

### Unit Test Results (Sprint 0)
**Date**: 2025-08-05

Email Parser Tests: 15/15 passing ✅
- Single email parsing: ✅
- Multiple email parsing: ✅

- Test prompt consistency across all models
- Document quality differences for final model selection
- Optimize temperature and token limits for consistent output

### Quality Assurance
- Maintain unit test coverage for all new functionality
- Test with various email formats and edge cases
- Ensure graceful error handling for model communication issues
- Document all technical decisions and rationale

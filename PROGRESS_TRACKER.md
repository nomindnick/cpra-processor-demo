## Technical Decisions Log

### Model Selection Analysis (Sprint 0)
**Date**: 2025-08-05

**Models Tested**:
- `gpt-oss:20b`: 21.6s response time, largest model (13GB), may have highest quality
- `gemma3:latest`: 5.4s response time, fastest, good response quality (3.3GB) 
- `phi4-mini-reasoning:3.8b`: 9.6s response time, medium speed, reasoning capabilities (3.2GB)

**Decision**: All three models are viable. Gemma3 appears most suitable for demo due to speed, but will test all three for analysis quality in Sprint 1.

### CPRA Analysis Implementation (Sprint 1)
**Date**: 2025-08-05

**Implementation Approach**: 
- Created `src/processors/cpra_analyzer.py` as main analysis orchestrator
- Enhanced `src/models/ollama_client.py` with improved responsiveness analysis methods
- Implemented structured prompting with JSON response format
- Added retry logic and comprehensive error handling

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- **Prompt Engineering**: Used clear criteria for responsiveness determination with confidence levels
- **JSON Response Handling**: Implemented markdown code block extraction for reliable parsing
- **Error Recovery**: 3-attempt retry logic with detailed error logging
- **Confidence Scoring**: High/Medium/Low levels based on relevance clarity
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple emails with progress callbacks

**Performance Results**:
- Gemma3:latest: 4-12s per email, reliable JSON output
- All 3 target models functional and tested
- 100% success rate on designed test cases
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (20 tests passing)

### Email Parsing Approach (Sprint 0)
**Date**: 2025-08-05

**Approach**: Implemented regex-based parsing for Outlook export format
- Handles standard email headers (From, To, CC, Subject, Date)
- Supports name-email format parsing ("John Smith <john@example.com>")
- Graceful error handling with failed email tracking
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (15 tests, all passing)

**Parsing Strategy**: Multiple fallback strategies for email separation:
1. Split by "From:" lines 
2. Split by separator patterns (dashes, underlines)
3. Treat as single email if no separators found

## Model Performance Notes

### Connectivity Testing Results
**Date**: 2025-08-05

All target models successfully loaded and responsive:
- Connection to Ollama service: ✅ Success
- Model availability: ✅ All 3 target models available
- Basic functionality: ✅ All models responding to test prompts

### Performance Observations
- Gemma3 provides fast, coherent responses
- Phi4-mini shows detailed reasoning in responses
- GPT-OSS has longest latency but may provide highest quality analysis

**Next Steps**: Implement structured prompting for CPRA analysis tasks in Sprint 1

## Issue Resolution Log

### Import Resolution (Sprint 0)
**Issue**: Relative imports failing in email parser module
**Solution**: Modified imports to use absolute paths from src directory
**Status**: Resolved - all tests passing

### Test Coverage (Sprint 0)
**Issue**: Needed comprehensive test coverage for email parsing
**Solution**: Implemented 15 unit tests covering:
- Basic email parsing
- Multiple email formats
- Address parsing variations
- Date format handling
- Error scenarios
**Status**: Complete - 100% test pass rate

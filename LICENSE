ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMER FOR GOVERNMENT USE:

⚠️ NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE - EDUCATIONAL DEMONSTRATION ONLY ⚠️

This software is provided SOLELY as a demonstration and educational tool to
illustrate the potential of local AI processing. It is NOT intended for actual
CPRA processing and WILL FAIL in production environments.

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS:
- This application WILL produce inaccurate results in real-world scenarios
- AI determinations of responsiveness and exemptions are inherently subjective
  and beyond the capability of small language models to accurately assess
- The simplified two-pass workflow is insufficient for production accuracy
- This tool is NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE
- Human review by qualified legal professionals is MANDATORY

Users are STRONGLY ADVISED to:
- Consult with legal counsel before any official use
- NOT rely on this software for actual CPRA compliance
- Thoroughly test and validate any adapted code
- Understand applicable laws and regulations including:
  * California Public Records Act (CPRA)
  * Local government transparency requirements
  * Data privacy and security regulations
  * Records retention policies

The authors and contributors make NO representations about the suitability of
this software for any particular government use case. This demonstration uses
synthetic data specifically designed to produce obvious results - real CPRA
requests involve far more complexity than this tool can handle.

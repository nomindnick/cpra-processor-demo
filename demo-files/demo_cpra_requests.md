## Demo Talking Points

### Why These Requests?
1. **Realistic Scenarios**: These represent common types of public records requests
2. **Exemption Variety**: Each triggers different CPRA exemptions
3. **Complexity Range**: From straightforward to nuanced responsiveness determinations

### What to Highlight:
- AI accurately identifies responsive documents based on content, not just keywords
- System flags potential exemptions for human review
- Confidence scoring helps prioritize review efforts
- Processing happens entirely offline - no data leaves the device

### Expected Non-Responsive Documents:
The system should correctly identify that emails about:
- Parks department budgets
- Library renovations  
- Employee vacation requests
- General safety training
- Vendor marketing materials
- Office policy updates

Are NOT responsive to any of these requests.

## Alternative Test Scenarios

### Broad Request (Tests Over-inclusion Prevention):
"All emails from city staff regarding any construction project in 2024"

### Narrow Request (Tests Precision):
"Email from Mike Rodriguez to David Kim on March 13, 2024 regarding contractor performance"

### Ambiguous Request (Tests Interpretation):
"Documents about problems with the Community Center"

## Notes for Demo
- Start with Request 1 as it's straightforward and has clear responsive documents
- Use Request 2 to demonstrate attorney-client privilege detection
- Request 3 showcases personnel records and deliberative process exemptions
- Process all three to show batch processing capabilities
- Emphasize that all processing happens locally in airplane mode
